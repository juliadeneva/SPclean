C programs (production) and Matlab scripts (tests) for cleaning RFI from PALFA single pulse event lists produced by the two single-pulse search algorithms used by the Cornell code (matched filter and friends-of-friends). These can be adapted to use single pulse lists from other codes. 

delays - max sample shift during dedispersion for the DM list used by the Cornell code to process PALFA data

spclean.c, spclean.h - driver

DFTclean.c - cleans out periodic radar blasts

ANDclean.c - cleans out RFI that is detected in multiple ALFA beams simultaneously

palfa-main.py - script to download single pulse event lists from the PALFA database at Cornell

*.m - Matlab scripts that were tests for the algorithms in DFTclean.c and ANDclean.c

*.sm - SuperMongo scripts for plotting single pulse events for a 7-beam pointings.
